Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a highly imbalanced dataset. The primary goal was to build a classification model with high precision and recall, ensuring that fraudulent transactions are accurately flagged while minimizing false positives.

(Note: Replace this placeholder with a real chart from your project, like the ROC Curve or a Confusion Matrix. This is highly effective for data science projects.)

üéØ Project Goal
To develop a robust machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions with over 95% precision. This involved extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling class imbalance, and fine-tuning model parameters.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries
Core Language: Python

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Imbalance Handling: SMOTE (from imblearn)

üìà Methodology
Data Loading & EDA: The dataset was loaded using Pandas. An initial exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the feature distributions and the severe class imbalance (very few fraud cases).

Data Preprocessing:

Features like Time and Amount were scaled using StandardScaler to prevent models from being biased towards features with larger ranges.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

Handling Class Imbalance: The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied only to the training data to create synthetic examples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions), resulting in a balanced training set. This is crucial to prevent data leakage.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the balanced (SMOTE-applied) training data.

Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated on the original, imbalanced testing set using:

Precision-Recall Curve: The most important metric for imbalanced classification.

ROC-AUC Score: To measure the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

Confusion Matrix: To visualize the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

üìä Results
Precision Score: > 95%

ROC-AUC Score: ~0.97

The model successfully achieved the goal of high precision, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions accurately from a highly imbalanced real-world dataset.
